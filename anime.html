"The Other World Demon Lord and the Summoning Girl's Slave Magic") is a Japanese light novel series written by Yukiya Murasaki and illustrated by Takahiro Tsurusaki. The light novels are published in English by J-Novel Club. A manga adaptation by Naoto Fukuda has been running since 2015, and is licensed by Seven Seas Entertainment.

     Plot
     Takuma Sakamoto is a hikikomori gamer who is mysteriously 
     transported to the virtual world of his favourite MMORPG,
      Cross Reverie, with the appearance of his own character 
      in the game, the Demon Lord Diablo. The two young girls who summoned him, the pantherian Rem and the elf Shera, attempt to use a spell to make Takuma their servant, but due to his magic ring with the ability "Magic Reflection", the spell rebounds, and both end up with magic collars stuck on their necks, thus becoming his servants instead. With a serious case of social anxiety, Takuma decides to act like his character while interacting with others, and makes use of his high stats and vast knowledge of Cross Reverie's lore to survive in his new environment, traveling along with Rem and Shera to look for a way to remove their slave collars, while helping them with their own personal
      issues that led them to summon him in the first place.

    Voiced by: Masaaki Mizunaka (Japanese); Eric Vale[3] (English)
    Takuma was a Cross Reverie player who controlled the character @Diablo-13, known as the true Demon Lord. He always defeated players with better equipment and overwhelming skills, always holding back for being too strong. But one day he was invoked into another world, appearing in the body of his character, Diablo, finding two girls, a Pantherian and an elf, who claimed to have summoned him and that he should be a slave to one of them, but due to his ring's ability, the magic has rebound back against them, becoming his slaves. Takuma has poor social skills, resulting in him speaking as his character to communicate; it comes off idiotic (to readers) since he doesn't grow out of this, despite the fact it causes more problems than necessary.
